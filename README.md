All the assignments were completed with his guidance and credits for questions go to him.

Assignment 1 and 2 mainly deal with mathematical derivations, assignments 3, 4 and 5 consists of coding.

For each assignment there is a separate folder, each coding task has a jupyter notebook as well as pdf version.

The codes deals with different classification problems, Neural network, ML techniques and algorithms such as linear regression, Bayesian regression, Kernel ridge regression, Robbins-Munro, APA, NLMS, RLS and back propagation algorithms 


Thank you!
